# a bowling game test
# how to score the game
# single game is 10 frames, each frame, each player has 2 opps to knock down 10 pins
# strike is 10 knocked down in the first shot + value of next two rolls
# spare is 10 knocked down in one frame, bonus = number of pins knocked down for the next roll only
# on tenth and final frame, if player rolls strike or spare you're allowed to roll those next 2 balls or 1 ball in terms of strike
# requirement:
    # class called game - 2 methods
    # roll that excepts pins, number of pins knocked down in that roll
    # score - returns total score that that player got, no parameters

# 2 rolls per frame, up to 20 rolls in the game
# extra roll at the end
