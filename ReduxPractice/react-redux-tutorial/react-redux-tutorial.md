![state diagram](/ReduxPractice/react-redux-tutorial/diag.png "state diagram")
- example react project
- login as a user - also creating user
- profile displays information - showing and displaying info and updating
- redux allows you to hold onto info about different states called a store.
    - store exists on index.js
    - holds all states and allows modification
    - access store thru every component
    - now you have global states without passing thru props

# redux-beginner into
- create an app that looks like the above pic, with two components for login and displaying the profile
