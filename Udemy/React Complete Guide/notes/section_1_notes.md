## what is react
a js lib for building UIs
a client-side js lib
- no need for loading, traditionally there is load time.
- van js allows to run logic in browser
- js can manipulate the DOM, the html elements rendered on the page
    - so we can change what the user sees without fetching a new html page

## why not just js?
- w/ js, a lot of code for simple actions and static
- step after step is written and cannot be scaled bc it becomes a lot of code

## what can react be used for?
- widgets, only a part of the page uses react
- entire pages too
- new pages are requested, we just swicth pages using react

## react alternatives
- angular, component based UI framework, alot more features and uses typescript from the beginning
- vue, mix of ang and react, less features then ang but more then react, for more medium sized projects
