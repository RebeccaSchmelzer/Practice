# dealing with errors
## types of errors
- parent element: needs an one parent tag or one enclosing tag at all times
- typos: check for those and make sure your calling the right element

## errors that dont show in terminal
- follow the logic from app.js
    - check logic thru chain of events
- check warning for more info and make sure each key is unique

## working with breakpoints
- check src code on the devtools
- add a breakpoint, click on the link point, where you think the error is happening
- then run the code or element that leads to the breakpoint
    - it will pause in the debugger
- step thru code, step by step, and use the step into next function call
    - will run to the next line of code after the breakpoint
- then run the debugger again for the next function call
