## why learn typescript
- ts is a superset of js
    - everything you can do in js you can do in ts
- doesnt add more features, just allows you to write js in a way with less errors, more precise
- if there is any error, already displayed before compilation - catch those errors before running
- not reinventing js - just asking u to write js more accurately
- dont use ts if only 2 files, use for large codebases
- all about type safety
    - odd behavior like 2 + "2" = "22"
    - this shouldnt be allowed
    - if type was consistent this wouldnt happen

## what typescript is not
- what it does - static checking
    - js is not built in with this
    - check code as you try to write it.
    - just analyzes code and tells u errors

## how it works
- ts is compiled into js - converted into js
- it's a dev tool to let you write better js code

## types
- num
- str
- bool
- null
- undef
- void
- obj
- arr
- tuples

- NOT ANY - any is not a keyword

## situations
- ex/ func excepts 2 nums
- ts checks the types 
- ex/ func returns str
- ts checks that a str is gonna check for that

## syntax
- let const-name: type = value
    - lower case!

## nums
- no float/int just numbers

## any
